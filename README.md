# Stata_codingsample2
The following document is one of the coding tests that I completed. This test involves using Stata to clean, wrangle, and visualize data, and build econometric models. The last part also involves using econometric knowledge to answer several short questions. The answers are my own work. Please do not distribute it without my permission. The folder can also be accessed on my GitHub.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77737512/220514293-6dc54c68-a46d-495c-a88b-4986e718d806.png)
